The use of constructs from functional programming languages in mainstream Object-Oriented languages is becoming increasingly pervasive. Through these mechanisms, developers can declaratively process native data structure like collections and infinite data structures. While they have many benefits, including succinct and nearly effortless (syntax-wise) parallelism, these language features are a byproduct of the combination of paradigms that may result in code that behaves in ways not expected by developers. Moreover, constructs and APIs written in this style may not behave in ways developers expect. This workshop aims to bring together both practitioners and researchers interested in this emerging topic with the goal of sharing results and ideas in solving crucial problems in the mass adaptation, correct usage, language and API design and implementation, and tool support of functional-inspired language constructs in mainstream OO languages. The workshop will also cover a broader view of this technology by incorporating additional artifacts beyond code, including requirements, specification, and tests for this new paradigm. Practitioners and researchers will be encouraged to engage in thought-provoking discussions surrounding these topics so that this relatively new technology has the best support for success. The workshop will also provide a productive and constructive setting for industry and academia collaboration.
