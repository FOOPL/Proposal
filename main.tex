\begin{abstract}
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) provide successful means for software reuse. However, over the past two decades, many researchers have shown inherent problems with APIs, such as providing useful documentation for proper use, detecting wrong usage patterns, and migrating between API versions. While these efforts have advanced the state of the art, most of these problems still exist today. We believe it is time to reflect and compare experiences from different prespectives and come up with new solutions to the above challenges. This workshop will advance the state of research of APIs by combining perspectives of the end users, designers, and maintainers of APIs.

In addition to attracting the community of researchers that usually attend ICSE and its co-located events (e.g., MSR and ICPC), we will make intensive efforts to involve local industry participants who can share their experience in using APIs, as well as researchers from South America.

\section{Motivation and Objectives}
%Motivation of the workshop's relevance to the field of software engineering.
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are an essential mechanism for software reuse. Software developers use a library or framework's APIs to leverage already implemented functionality. The first step to do so is to understand what available libraries provide the target functionality, what their trade-offs are, and any special setup they may require. Once an API has been identified, the developer using it has to figure out the API's \textit{specification}, which enforces the way the API can be used such as any method call ordering or parameter value restrictions. Unfortunately, this is not the end of the journey for an API's user. If the library's own developers decide to change its APIs, this might break existing software that relied on the previous version of the API. Thus, as the API user's code evolves, she must decide if she wants to use the new API version and determine how the changes will impact her code.

There has been a vast amount of research that tackles each of the above problems separately (e.g.,~\cite{Subramanian:2014,RobillardInferenceSurvey,RobillardLearn09, NNP+09, ThungLibRec}). However, recent work still shows that API usability and evolution are still issues~\cite{NKMB16, BKHT:FSE16, SunshineAPIProtocol}, often with severe consequences such as security vulnerabilities~\cite{EgeleBFK13}. 

\subsection{Goals and Outcomes}
\label{sec:goals}
%Anticipated goals and outcomes of the workshop (e.g., open research problems to pursue, validation objectives, empirical studies).
To create a more comprehensive solution that allows easier and more correct usages of APIs, we believe that it is time for... For example, some of the open problems that still need to be addressed are:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{API Quality:} When faced with a choice of multiple APIs that provide the same functionality, what makes one API better than another? What are suitable quality metrics of an API and can we automatically measure them?

\item \textbf{API Usage Recommenders and Misuse Detectors:} To propose ways to use an API or to detect whether some client code correctly uses an API, most techniques rely on mining patterns or specifications from large amounts of client code. The underlying assumption here is that the majority of users ``do it right'' while the anomalous behavior represents the misuse. However, this is not always the case. One important example is security APIs. How can we make use of the vast amount of available client code but still accurately identify correct patterns? What would be the best representation for these patterns? Additionally, what is the best way to present these usage recommendations or misuse-detection results to the developer? 

\item\textbf{API Documentation:} How can we provide better documentation for APIs? What kind of documentation would end users find useful?

\item \textbf{API Evolution:} How can we help library designers safely evolve their APIs? How can we help library users adapt their code to API changes?

\item \textbf{API Re-design:} How can we help API designers improve their API based on how developers use it?
\end{itemize}

The aim of the workshop is to create a synergy between the above research areas with the overall goal of improving the design and use of APIs. It also provides a means for young researchers to understand the open challenges in the area and to discuss their ideas for addressing them.

\section{Format and Required Services}

%Workshop format (e.g., paper presentations, keynotes, breakout sessions, panel-like discussions) and plans for generating and stimulating discussions.
%Desired length of the workshop (i.e. 1 or 2 days).
%Special services that are needed; logistic and/or equipment constraints.
We propose a 1-day workshop with the following format:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Morning keynote speaker.} This will either be an established researcher who provides some background of the area and the open challenges or a practitioner who can highlight the current challenges faced in practice.
\item \textit{Presentation sessions.} These sessions will be divided into different themes. These themes will be based on the topics of the accepted papers and talks, but are likely going to be related to the topics mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:goals}. Each session will start with a few presentations and will end with an open discussion of the topic. 
\item \textit{Breakout session.} We will have a breakout session at the end of the workshop where participants will be divided into different groups. The goal of this session is to enable more in-depth discussion of interesting topics that have emerged from the open discussions of the previous sessions. It would also help those interested in the similar topics to foster new collaborations. A representative from each group would then report the outcomes of the discussion to the whole workshop.
\end{itemize}

To run the workshop, we would need a room equipped with a projector and that can hold around 40 people .

\section{Target Audience}

Our goal is to have 20-40 participants from both industry and academia. Given the relevant topic of the workshop to the ICSE audience, we expect around 30 participants.

\subsection{Attendee Background} 
%Required background of the workshop attendees.
%Whether a Mix of industry and research participants is being sought.
%Desired minimum and maximum number of workshop participants, expected number of participants.
We aim for a variety of target audience background, depending on what perspective they look at APIs from. For example, the audience may have backgrounds such as program analysis, usability and HCI, mining software repositories, or software evolution. Alternatively, they can be end-users of APIs that are interested in voicing suggestions or concerns about their current experience in using certain APIs in their projects. That way, participants who specialize in one aspect of working with APIs can learn about other related areas as well.

\subsection{Participant Selection}
%Participant solicitation and selection process, including whether the workshop will be open or closed.
The goal of the workshop is to come up with new directions for improving the use of APIs and overcoming the challenges that emerged over the past several years. To that end, the workshop will be open to anyone who would like to attend and contribute to the discussion. While paper proceedings and talks will undergo a selection process, everyone is welcome to register for attending the workshop. 

\section{Proceedings}
%How many and what type of contributions will be solicited (number of pages and type: extended abstracts, position and/or research papers, etc.).

We will solicit both research papers and position papers. Both types of papers will be four pages long. To encourage local industry participation, we will also call for talk abstracts. Such talks can focus on challenges faced in industry and stir up interesting discussion in the workshop. We will ask the local ICSE organizers to forward the workshop's CFP to local industry contacts.

\subsection{Evaluation Process}
All three types of submissions will be peer-reviewed by three program committee (PC) members. Here is a list of the proposed PC, where names in bold are committed members.\todo{update after contacting people}
