\begin{abstract}
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are an essential mechanism for software reuse. However, over the past two decades, many researchers have shown inherent problems with APIs, such as providing useful documentation for proper use, detecting wrong usage patterns, and migrating between API versions. While research efforts have advanced the state of the art, most of these problems still exist today. We believe it is time to reflect and compare experiences from different perspectives and come up with new solutions to the above challenges. This workshop will advance the state of research of APIs by combining perspectives of the end users, designers, and maintainers of APIs.

In addition to attracting the community of researchers that usually attend ICSE and its co-located events (e.g., MSR and ICPC), we will make intensive efforts to involve local industry participants who can share their experience in using and maintaining APIs, as well as researchers from South America.

\section{Motivation and Objectives}
%Motivation of the workshop's relevance to the field of software engineering.
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are an essential mechanism for software reuse. Software developers use a library or framework's APIs to leverage already implemented functionality. In order to do so, they first have to understand which available libraries provide the desired functionality, what each library's trade-offs are, and which special setup each may require. Once an adequate library has been identified, developers need to figure out the respective API's \textit{specification}, which defines the way the API can be used. For example, they need to understand which types to use, which methods to call in which order and with which parameter-values, in order to leverage the desired functionality. And this is only the beginning of the journey. If the library's developers decide to change its APIs, this might break existing software that relies on a previous version of the API. Thus, as the API evolves, users must decide whether or not they want to migrate to the new API version and determine how the changes will impact their code.

There has been a vast amount of research that tackles each of the above problems separately (e.g.,~\cite{Subramanian:2014,RobillardInferenceSurvey,RobillardLearn09, NNP+09, ThungLibRec}). However, recent work shows that API usability and evolution are still issues~\cite{NKMB16, BKHT:FSE16, SunshineAPIProtocol}, often with severe consequences such as security vulnerabilities~\cite{EgeleBFK13}. 

\subsection{Goals and Outcomes}
\label{sec:goals}
%Anticipated goals and outcomes of the workshop (e.g., open research problems to pursue, validation objectives, empirical studies).
To create a more comprehensive solution that allows easier and more correct usages of APIs, we believe that it is time to reflect and consolidate results and experiences from different perspectives on APIs and to come up with solutions to some of the open problems that still need to be addressed, such as:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{API Quality:} When faced with a choice of multiple APIs that provide the same functionality, what makes one API better than another? What are suitable quality metrics of an API and can we automatically measure them?

\item \textbf{API-Usage Recommenders and Misuse Detectors:} To propose ways to use an API or to detect whether some client code correctly uses an API, most techniques rely on mining patterns or specifications from large amounts of client code. The underlying assumption here is that the majority of users ``do it right'', while the anomalous behavior represents the misuse. However, this is not always the case. One important example is security APIs. How can we make use of the vast amount of available client code but still accurately identify correct patterns? What would be the best representation for these patterns? Additionally, what is the best way to present these usage recommendations or misuse-detection results to the developer? 

\item\textbf{API Documentation:} How can we provide better documentation for APIs? What kind of documentation would end users find useful? How can we ensure up-to-date documentation? And which format best supports developers in grasping an API's specification?

\item \textbf{API Evolution:} How can we help library designers safely evolve their APIs? How can we detect breaking changes in APIs? How can we help library users migrate their code to new API versions?

\item \textbf{API Design:} How can we help API designers improve their API based on how developers use it? Can we automatically identify frequent similar usages or usage clones as candidates to extend a library's functionality?
\end{itemize}

The aim of the workshop is to create a synergy between the above research areas with the overall goal of improving the design and use of APIs. It also provides a means for young researchers to understand the open challenges in the area and to discuss their ideas for addressing them.

\section{Format and Required Services}

%Workshop format (e.g., paper presentations, keynotes, breakout sessions, panel-like discussions) and plans for generating and stimulating discussions.
%Desired length of the workshop (i.e. 1 or 2 days).
%Special services that are needed; logistic and/or equipment constraints.
We propose a 1-day workshop with the following format:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Morning keynote speaker.} This will either be an established researcher who provides some background of the area and the open challenges or a practitioner who can highlight the current challenges faced in industry.
\item \textbf{Presentation sessions.} These sessions will be divided into different themes, based on the topics of the accepted papers and talks, but are likely going to be related to the topics mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:goals}. Each session will start with a few presentations and end with an open discussion of the topic. 
\item \textbf{Breakout session.} We will have a breakout session at the end of the workshop where participants will be divided into different groups. The goal of this session is to enable more in-depth discussion of interesting topics that emerged in the open discussions of the previous sessions. It will also help those interested in similar topics to foster new collaborations. At the session's end, a representative from each group will report the outcomes of the discussion to the whole workshop.
\end{itemize}

To run the workshop, we would need a room that is equipped with a projector and that can hold around 40 people.

\section{Target Audience}

Our goal is to have 20-40 participants from both industry and academia. Given the relevance of the workshop's topic to the ICSE audience, we expect around 30 participants.

\subsection{Attendee Background} 
%Required background of the workshop attendees.
%Whether a Mix of industry and research participants is being sought.
%Desired minimum and maximum number of workshop participants, expected number of participants.
We aim for a variety of target-audience background, with respect to the perspective from which participants look at APIs. For example, the audience may have backgrounds such as program analysis, usability and HCI, mining software repositories, or software evolution. Alternatively, they may be end-users of APIs who are interested in voicing suggestions or concerns about their current experience in using (certain) APIs in their projects. That way, participants who specialize in one aspect of working with APIs can learn about other related areas and share insights from their particular viewpoints.

\subsection{Participant Selection}
%Participant solicitation and selection process, including whether the workshop will be open or closed.
The goal of the workshop is to come up with new directions for improving the use of APIs and overcoming the challenges that emerged over the past several years. To that end, the workshop will be open to anyone who would like to attend and contribute to the discussion. While paper proceedings and talks will undergo a selection process, everyone is welcome to register for attending the workshop. 

\section{Proceedings}
%How many and what type of contributions will be solicited (number of pages and type: extended abstracts, position and/or research papers, etc.).

We will solicit research papers, practice papers, position papers, or experience reports. All types of papers will be four pages long. To encourage local industry participation, we will also call for talk abstracts. Such talks can focus on challenges faced in industry and stir up interesting discussion in the workshop. We will ask the local ICSE organizers to forward the workshop's CFP to local industry contacts.

\subsection{Evaluation Process}
All three types of submissions will be peer-reviewed by three program committee (PC) members. Here is a list of the proposed PC, where names in bold are committed members.\todo{update after contacting people}

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are an essential mechanism for software reuse. However, over the past two decades, many researchers have shown inherent problems with APIs, such as providing useful documentation for proper use, detecting correct usage patterns or wrong usages, and migrating between API versions. While these efforts have advanced the state of the art, most of these problems still exist today. We believe it is time to reflect and compare experiences from different perspectives and to come up with new solutions to the above challenges. 

The first International Workshop on API Usage and Evolution (APItude) provides a venue for researchers and practitioners to come together and discuss the open challenges that API users face. Improving the current state of APIs combines different research areas such as mining software repositories, program analysis, HCI, software evolution, and software documentation. The goal of the workshop is to identify the current open challenges in the area and define a roadmap for innovative solutions, even in the face of poor documentation and evolution. These solutions can eventually also be helpful to API designers themselves.
